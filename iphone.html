        <p>In 2007, the world took a major step forward regarding telephones. Steve Jobs created one of the most innovative pieces of technology the world has ever seen. The iPhone blew everyone away with the fact that all buttons were taken away and it mainly relied on touch-screen technology. It was also the first phone that could run websites built for computers to run. Although it was much more expensive than its competition at the time, it had a lot more battery time and the screen was the size of the phone. The iPhone ran on the 2G wireless service that was exclusive with AT&T, but ended a few years later. It also required a computer to set up the iPhone in the first place. Over 6 million iPhones were sold in first year of it being released to the public. Just under a year later, the iPhone 3G was announced and released. It could run on 3G wireless internet now. It included a headphone jack, a contact search to find certain numbers in your phonebook, the ability to save images to the phone, support for many languages other than English, and parental controls so parents could change what their kids could have on their phones and lock other things away, but other than that, it wasn't much different than the first iPhone. It was much more affordable than the first iPhone, costing only $199 at launch. Later the following year, Apple revealed that the iPhone 3G sold around 6.9 million units, besting the iPhone's previous record.</p>
