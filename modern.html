        <p>In 2021, phones have advanced by a vast margin compared to older phones. It's honestly amazing how much technology has advanced in such a small amount of time. Newer phones like the iPhone X and Samsung S10 have brought us new features such as face-scanning technology used to unlock your phone instead of a password that keeps everyone out of your phone. It also has the ability to watch videos and play third-party games on the device by downloading the app through the app store on the device. It has dual-lens cameras, which are found on professional cameras. The iPhone X and Samsung are much more durable than previous designs of mobile phones, thanks to the improved waterproofing and Gorilla Glass that is applied to the screen to prevent cracks. Both phones feature their own version of an AI assistant that responds to your voice and listens to every command you give her. The iPhone's is named Siri and the Samsung's is named Cortana. On launch, both costed around $999 with 64GB or $1,149 with 256 GB. They both use a 4G LTE network of wireless internet and can use 5G if avaliable and also have up to 13 hours of battery life. </p>
