        <p>The first telephone was a very robust machine. Alexander Graham Bell's phone worked by converting sound into electrical signal using a "liquid transmitter". The sound would funnel into a receiver and be directed towards a membrane over a drum. Outside of the drum, a cork with a needle attached to a battery extended to cup that has sulphuric acid and a metal contact. When the sound connects with the membrane, it causes vibrations, causing the the strength of the current between the needle and contact to vary. This was then put through a receiver and reverse process and re-created sound. The first telephone was really just an improved version of the telegraph. The first telephone call occured on June 2, 1875. It consisted of Bell shouting a now famous sentence into the mouthpiece. "Watson, come here-I want to see you".</p>
