        <p>The first flip phone released onto the market in 1989. It was called the Motorola MicroTAC. It was much different than the previous "brick model". You could keep this phone in your pocket, marking it as the first mobile phone. The flip design made using a phone extremely simple, the mouthpiece was embedded in a plastic flap. The flap protected the number pad when closed and ensured the microphone was positioned nearer the ownerâ€™s mouth when open. It had a monochrome LED display, a 12 button number pad with key functions associated with each one, and an internal phone book that could save a number. The battery within would barely last at all throughout the day. The phone was recreated over many years, each with their own small tweaks and improvements. It was discontinued in 1997. The big model was the Motorola StarTAC. It was very similar to the previous design of the MicroTAC, but was significantly lighter and smaller. It was considered to be the first phone with a clamshell design, meaning it had two halves that were almost exactly the same size. It was also the first phone that was able to send and receive SMS messages and had a vibrate alert. Owners were able to opt for a lithium ion battery for their phone as well. It was much more affordable for customers, only costing $1,000, resulting in it resonating with customers much more than any previous phone. Motorola sold over 60 million of them. After developing the StarTAC and the MicroTAC, it led Motorola to develop their most popular device yet.</p>
