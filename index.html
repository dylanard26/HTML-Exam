    <h1>The Telephone's History</h1>
    <h3 class="mile1">The First Telephone</h3>

        <p>The first telephone was a very robust machine. Alexander Graham Bell's phone worked by converting sound into electrical signal using a "liquid transmitter". The sound would funnel into a receiver and be directed towards a membrane over a drum. Outside of the drum, a cork with a needle attached to a battery extended to cup that has sulphuric acid and a metal contact. When the sound connects with the membrane, it causes vibrations, causing the the strength of the current between the needle and contact to vary. This was then put through a receiver and reverse process and re-created sound. The first telephone was really just an improved version of the telegraph. The first telephone call occured on June 2, 1875. It consisted of Bell shouting a now famous sentence into the mouthpiece. "Watson, come here-I want to see you".</p>

        <p>The rotary telephone was a large step up from the first telephone. You could call specific numbers by dialing it in using the number pad. By turning the dial, it would send pulses to the receiver registered to the specific phone that is being called. At first, there was small metal pieces with the numbers on them used to dial, but were eventually replaced by holes that people could put their fingers into to easily turn the dial. You can still use a rotary phone today, depending on if your phone service offers it because it uses pulses instead of strong electrical signals. Production of rotary telephones ceased in 1980, for newer and more advanced phones began to release. Over the years, there have been many different models of rotary telephones. The first model was the Candlestick Model 50AL. It was popularized off of big headlines about it being the first free-standing telephone. The model 102 was a step-up from the Candlestick. Created in 1927, it had a round base with a receiver on top instead of the Candlestick's extended neck. The size of the base caused the dial on the front to be much larger and easier to access. The Model 302 was the first telephone to cast in plastic. It is pictured above. The base contained much of the circuit wires, which made it much more compact than previous models. The Model 500 was even more advanced because of the ringer that was placed within the base of the phone. It also offered to be purchased in more than one color. The Model 701, also known as the Princess Phone, released in the 1950s and was shown off as a cute bedside phone for women. It was much smaller than previous designs. </p>

        <p>The first flip phone released onto the market in 1989. It was called the Motorola MicroTAC. It was much different than the previous "brick model". You could keep this phone in your pocket, marking it as the first mobile phone. The flip design made using a phone extremely simple, the mouthpiece was embedded in a plastic flap. The flap protected the number pad when closed and ensured the microphone was positioned nearer the ownerâ€™s mouth when open. It had a monochrome LED display, a 12 button number pad with key functions associated with each one, and an internal phone book that could save a number. The battery within would barely last at all throughout the day. The phone was recreated over many years, each with their own small tweaks and improvements. It was discontinued in 1997. The big model was the Motorola StarTAC. It was very similar to the previous design of the MicroTAC, but was significantly lighter and smaller. It was considered to be the first phone with a clamshell design, meaning it had two halves that were almost exactly the same size. It was also the first phone that was able to send and receive SMS messages and had a vibrate alert. Owners were able to opt for a lithium ion battery for their phone as well. It was much more affordable for customers, only costing $1,000, resulting in it resonating with customers much more than any previous phone. Motorola sold over 60 million of them. After developing the StarTAC and the MicroTAC, it led Motorola to develop their most popular device yet.</p>

        <p>In 2007, the world took a major step forward regarding telephones. Steve Jobs created one of the most innovative pieces of technology the world has ever seen. The iPhone blew everyone away with the fact that all buttons were taken away and it mainly relied on touch-screen technology. It was also the first phone that could run websites built for computers to run. Although it was much more expensive than its competition at the time, it had a lot more battery time and the screen was the size of the phone. The iPhone ran on the 2G wireless service that was exclusive with AT&T, but ended a few years later. It also required a computer to set up the iPhone in the first place. Over 6 million iPhones were sold in first year of it being released to the public. Just under a year later, the iPhone 3G was announced and released. It could run on 3G wireless internet now. It included a headphone jack, a contact search to find certain numbers in your phonebook, the ability to save images to the phone, support for many languages other than English, and parental controls so parents could change what their kids could have on their phones and lock other things away, but other than that, it wasn't much different than the first iPhone. It was much more affordable than the first iPhone, costing only $199 at launch. Later the following year, Apple revealed that the iPhone 3G sold around 6.9 million units, besting the iPhone's previous record.</p>

        <p>In 2021, phones have advanced by a vast margin compared to older phones. It's honestly amazing how much technology has advanced in such a small amount of time. Newer phones like the iPhone X and Samsung S10 have brought us new features such as face-scanning technology used to unlock your phone instead of a password that keeps everyone out of your phone. It also has the ability to watch videos and play third-party games on the device by downloading the app through the app store on the device. It has dual-lens cameras, which are found on professional cameras. The iPhone X and Samsung are much more durable than previous designs of mobile phones, thanks to the improved waterproofing and Gorilla Glass that is applied to the screen to prevent cracks. Both phones feature their own version of an AI assistant that responds to your voice and listens to every command you give her. The iPhone's is named Siri and the Samsung's is named Cortana. On launch, both costed around $999 with 64GB or $1,149 with 256 GB. They both use a 4G LTE network of wireless internet and can use 5G if avaliable and also have up to 13 hours of battery life. </p>
