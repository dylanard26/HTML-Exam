        <p>The first telephone was a very robust machine. Alexander Graham Bell's phone worked by converting sound into electrical signal using a "liquid transmitter". The sound would funnel into a receiver and be directed towards a membrane over a drum. Outside of the drum, a cork with a needle attached to a battery extended to cup that has sulphuric acid and a metal contact. When the sound connects with the membrane, it causes vibrations, causing the the strength of the current between the needle and contact to vary. This was then put through a receiver and reverse process and re-created sound. The first telephone was really just an improved version of the telegraph. The first telephone call occured on June 2, 1875. It consisted of Bell shouting a now famous sentence into the mouthpiece. "Watson, come here-I want to see you".</p>

        <p>The rotary telephone was a large step up from the first telephone. You could call specific numbers by dialing it in using the number pad. By turning the dial, it would send pulses to the receiver registered to the specific phone that is being called. At first, there was small metal pieces with the numbers on them used to dial, but were eventually replaced by holes that people could put their fingers into to easily turn the dial. You can still use a rotary phone today, depending on if your phone service offers it because it uses pulses instead of strong electrical signals. Production of rotary telephones ceased in 1980, for newer and more advanced phones began to release. Over the years, there have been many different models of rotary telephones. The first model was the Candlestick Model 50AL. It was popularized off of big headlines about it being the first free-standing telephone. The model 102 was a step-up from the Candlestick. Created in 1927, it had a round base with a receiver on top instead of the Candlestick's extended neck. The size of the base caused the dial on the front to be much larger and easier to access. The Model 302 was the first telephone to cast in plastic. It is pictured above. The base contained much of the circuit wires, which made it much more compact than previous models. The Model 500 was even more advanced because of the ringer that was placed within the base of the phone. It also offered to be purchased in more than one color. The Model 701, also known as the Princess Phone, released in the 1950s and was shown off as a cute bedside phone for women. It was much smaller than previous designs. </p>
